# gbEM
Purpose:
take Boltzmann statistics picture of all the GB structues
the final results will be given in a .cfg file with different color coding scheme
for std of locations, mean of types, and std of types

Usage:
in EM.param
Nconfigs: specify total number of configurations
refFile: reference structure which will be used as the final output structure as an atomic meshing grid
halfThick: cutoff of grain boundary thickness on each side
